## Thinking of submitting a talk?

You don't need to be a very experienced speaker. Many speakers gave their first talk at one of our monthly events and <strong>we can mentor you</strong> to get your talk right for SOTB.

Talks at SOTB are <em>25 minutes</em>. The loose theme for the event is: <em>&ldquo;Rise of the Browsers&rdquo;</em> but we'd welcome submissions on any aspect of modern web design and development.

SOTB is run by volunteers, is not-for-profit, and we keep ticket prices as low as possible. We don't pay speakers but we will cover UK travel and accommodation.
