<h2 id=porting-a-large-windows-app-to-the-web>Porting a large Windows app to the web</h2><p>We ported Construct 2 - a game development IDE with around a quarter of a million lines of C++ code - to the browser. We launched Construct 3 in beta this year and it&#39;s now live at construct.net. We have some pretty unique experience of developing complex web apps and there were some interesting challenges and successes along the way. I&#39;d probably touch on some of the topics I&#39;ve blogged about recently (time permitting!), such as <a href=https://www.scirra.com/blog/ashley/34/html-imports-are-the-best-web-component>HTML imports</a> - and <a href=https://www.scirra.com/blog/ashley/35/layout-is-the-next-frontier-of-web-app-performance>layout performance</a></p>
